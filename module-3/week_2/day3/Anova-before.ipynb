    "# ANOVA \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a method for generalizing statistical tests to multiple groups. As you'll see, ANOVA  analyses the overall variance of a dataset by partitioning the total sum of square of deviations (from the mean) into sum of squares for each of these groups and sum of squares for error. By comparing statistical test for multiple groups, it can serve as a useful alternative to the $t$-tests you've encountered thus far, when you wish to test multiple factors simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Use ANOVA for testing multiple pairwise comparisons\n",
    "* Understand and explain the methodology behind ANOVA tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main problem is: Can we determine whether a set of population means are the same or different from samples from these populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural Question: Hint: What other test we were using for similar procedure - why can't we use the same (or modified version) here? (Let's count if we have 10 different population how many tests we should do in total?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even if we were able to use above method, what happens to the significance levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea: We will compare variances within the group with the total variance to be able to say that whether population means are equal or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Wait!!__ Why use the variance to compare the means?\n",
